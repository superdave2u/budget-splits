# budget-splits

This application is meant to help with household budgeting. The example is between two W2 employees with a variety of bills.

In the budget, some bills are split evently 50/50% while others are split equitably as percentage of household income.

Also, not all contributions to this budget from a paycheck are required for every deposit.

It's common for salaried employees to have two pay cycles each year fall into a month as a 3rd check. Budgets that don't account for this will "overpopulate" some categories.
